# To-Do-List

I built a To-Do List website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to help users manage their daily tasks in a simple and efficient way. The project allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, ensuring productivity and organization. It also features a Dark/Light mode toggle for a personalized user experience. With a clean UI and responsive layout, the project demonstrates my skills in front-end development, DOM manipulation, and interactive web design.
